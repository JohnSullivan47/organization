In an [earlier post](2018/07/05/not-just-open-access-embracing-fair-oa/), we explained our commitment to the [principles](https://www.fairopenaccess.org/) elaborated by the Fair Open Access Alliance (FOAA). As mediastudies.press gets closer to a formal launch, we decided to craft a formal statement of OA principles. In our research, we stumbled across Jean-Sébastien Caux‘s more demanding adaptation of the FOAA principles—which more emphasis on zero-fee, nonprofit, and academic integrity dimensions. Caux, who created the innovative [SciPost](https://scipost.org/) OA publication platform, found the FOAA principles [“too much of a compromise,”](https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2018/05/05/genuine-open-access/) and set out to revise and expand them into what he calls the [Genuine Open Access Principles](https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2018/05/05/genuine-open-access/). 

This can all look a bit like hair-splitting, but the details matter here—and Caux’s principles are a bitter match for the mediastudies.press mission. Our [statement of OA principles](/about/oa-policy/) adapts the Caux list.
